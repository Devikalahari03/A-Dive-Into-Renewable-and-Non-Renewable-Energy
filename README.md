# On-Track-A-Dive-Into-Renewable-and-Non-Renewable-Energy
Climate change is affecting the entire world. I wanted to take a look into how the top two energy producers are faring against the Paris Agreement.

This project was cleaned in Excel, explored through SQL, visualized through Tableau, and presented in PowerPoint. For this project, I used the following data set between the years of 1990-2019(as data was incomplete for 2020) which can be found below: http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&f=cmID%3AEC

I began my analysis focused on the top 10 countries from all around the world based off of their net installed energy capacity. I then decided to narrow my focus to the top two net installed energy producers, USA and China

Comparing 65,989 records to find if the top two energy producers (USA & China) are in line with the Paris Agreement. 

→ Explored renewable energy capacities of both the USA and China and found that since 1990 China has had over 10x growth in hydro. Making up the largest portion of their renewable energy at 4 billion kWh. 

→ Discovered that 77% of Brazil’s and Sweden’s energy production is renewable. 

→ Concluded that by 2030 China will be 61% renewable energy and the USA will be 41% renewable energy falling short of the 2/3rd renewable energy goal set in the Paris Agreement by using forecasting tools.
